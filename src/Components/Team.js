      I joined Chandigarh University to pursue a Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science and Engineering, specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. In my first semester, I dove headfirst into the world of technology and innovation, where I had the opportunity to work on an exciting project: a rain alarm using IoT.

This project involved integrating various sensors and components to create a smart system that could detect rain and alert users in real time.
Creating the rain alarm was a significant milestone in my academic journey, showcasing my ability to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world challenges. It marked the beginning of my exploration into the vast possibilities of AI and IoT, setting the stage for my future projects and aspirations in this dynamic field.

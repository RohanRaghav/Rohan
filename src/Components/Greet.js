     In my fifth semester, I took my development skills to new heights by joining the CAC Club as a Full Stack Developer. This role gave me the opportunity to work on multiple projects, applying my expertise in both front-end and back-end development to deliver impactful solutions. Each project under the CAC Club helped me grow as a developer, enhancing my problem-solving skills and broadening my technical horizons.
Simultaneously, I also joined the AIT Traids Society as a Full Stack Developer. This allowed me to further expand my portfolio by contributing to various innovative projects. Both roles offered a rich platform to collaborate with talented peers, sharpen my skills, and bring creative ideas to life.
Being actively involved in these clubs not only bolstered my development abilities but also enriched my understanding of teamwork, leadership, and real-world project management.

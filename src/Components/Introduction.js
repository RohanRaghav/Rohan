        I completed my 10th grade at Taksh-Shila Model Sr. Sec. School, where I laid the groundwork for my academic success, achieving a commendable score of 90.4%. Building on that foundation, I continued to excel in my studies during 12th grade, earning a remarkable 83.6%.
In parallel with my 12th, I pursued a diploma in Office Automation and Web Development. This dual effort not only deepened my understanding of core subjects but also honed my technical skills in programming with C and Tally ERP, along with the essentials of web development. Balancing both academic and practical training was challenging but incredibly rewarding, as it prepared me well for my future endeavors and provided me with a solid skill set before even stepping into college.

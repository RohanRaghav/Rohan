       In my second semester at Chandigarh University, I took an active role in campus life by joining several clubs, including the Google Developer Student Club (GDSC), the Art of Living Club, and the IEEE Society as a student member. Engaging with these organizations allowed me to volunteer in various events, where I not only contributed my skills but also learned from like-minded peers and experienced professionals.
During this time, I also embarked on an ambitious project called Prodent. Leveraging my extensive web development expertise, I created a versatile e-commerce website tailored for diverse industries. This dynamic platform serves as an efficient marketplace that facilitates the buying and selling of projects across multiple fields. With a user-friendly interface and seamless functionality, Prodent aims to connect buyers and sellers, enhancing their experience and making transactions smooth and effective.
